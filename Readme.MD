## Download module

This module was made for my own personal use, anyone can use it, but some you may find some errors if you use it
There are already nice download modules but i decided to make my module to implement my syntax, i'm just trying some things here

## How to use

install the module with pip.

Windows:
```powershell
pip install timot-ben

```
Linux:
```bash
pip install timot-ben
```

import the module in your scripts and use it to download files.

```python
import timot_ben
