## Command line download tool

This is a simple command line tool for me to use in my other software without needing to re-write the download part again and again.
Probably this will be part of a suite for me to use. (use is if you want but don't expect me to change the behavor of this tool).

usage (make suthe the output is located in a directory you have access to or run it as admin)

```powershell
ben -l "https://you_download_file.zip" -o "C:\you_download_file.zip"

```
